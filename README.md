# CleanTech-Transforming-Waste-Management-with-Transfer-Learning
CleanTech is an AI-powered waste classification system that utilizes deep learning and transfer learning to automate the sorting of waste materials. It aims to improve recycling efficiency and reduce human effort by classifying waste into categories such as organic, recyclable, and hazardous using image recognition models.

Project Objective
The objective of CleanTech is to develop an intelligent and automated system for waste classification that uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The model accurately identifies the type of waste based on images, allowing for real-time and hygienic sorting in smart bins or industrial setups.

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet50)

Flask (for deployment)

Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Raspberry Pi and Camera (optional for hardware integration)

Key Features
Real-time waste classification using transfer learning

High accuracy and efficiency in identifying waste categories

Scalable solution for households, public waste bins, or industries

Optional hardware integration for automated sorting

Potential for dashboard analytics and monitoring via IoT

How It Works
Waste image is captured using a camera or uploaded manually.

The image is preprocessed and analyzed by a CNN model.

The model classifies the image into one of the predefined waste categories.

The output can trigger a mechanism (e.g., servo motor) to direct the waste into the appropriate bin.

Model Performance
Validation Accuracy: 92.5%

Precision: 90.8%

Recall: 91.3%

Inference Time: Less than 1 second per image (on edge device)

Dataset
The model is trained using a publicly available waste classification dataset from Kaggle, consisting of labeled images categorized as organic, recyclable, hazardous, etc.

Advantages
Reduces manual segregation errors

Encourages cleaner recycling processes

Improves hygiene and efficiency

Reduces workload for waste management staff

Limitations
Classification accuracy depends on lighting and image clarity

Initial hardware cost for full automation

Limited accuracy for unseen waste types or mixed waste

Future Scope
Expand dataset to support more diverse waste categories

Integrate with cloud platforms for real-time monitoring and analytics

Develop a mobile app for home waste segregation assistance

Deploy robotic arms for more precise mechanical sorting
